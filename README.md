# Nihal Gunukula

👋 Hi! I'm **Nihal Gunukula**, a Computer Science student at Purdue University building privacy-preserving ML infrastructure.

## What I'm Building

I'm the **Founder & CEO of [Phyvant](https://phyvant.com)**, a privacy-preserving ML platform for regulated industries. We enable enterprises to train models on sensitive data using federated fine-tuning with differential privacy—so companies like hospitals, law firms, and financial institutions can leverage their data without privacy risks.

**First customer:** [Cargill](https://www.cargill.com/) (world's largest private company). Active conversations with healthcare systems, law firms, and financial services companies.

## Experience

- **Founder & CEO** @ [Phyvant](https://phyvant.com) — Building federated learning infrastructure with RLHF, DPO, and differential privacy
- **ML Engineer** @ [Mercor](https://www.mercor.com/research/) — RLHF systems for model quality at a $10B+ Series C startup
- **Software Engineer** @ Litewave — Built pharmaceutical document intelligence pipelines with Neo4j, FAISS, and Kubernetes

## Research

- **First-author paper** at IROS 2025: [PathCluster: Pedestrian Group-Adaptive Social Navigation in Dense Crowds](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/IROS25/program/IROS25_ContentListWeb_2.html)
- Research with [Professor Aniket Bera](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ab/) at [IDEAS Lab](https://ideas.cs.purdue.edu/), Purdue
- [MIRACLE: Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03651) — arXiv 2023

## Education

**Purdue University** — BS Computer Science, Minor in Mathematics (Expected May 2027)
- CS Outstanding Freshman Award (single recipient among 800+ students)
- 4x Dean's List, 2x Semester Honors
- Won $45K+ in pitch competitions and hackathons

## Interests

Privacy-preserving ML, federated learning, RLHF (PPO, DPO), distributed systems, and building infrastructure that works under constraints. Long-term, I'm drawn to problems where ML meets high-stakes decisions: healthcare, defense, autonomous systems.
